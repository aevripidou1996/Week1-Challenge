# Week1-Challenge

## Description
This is a submission of week 1 challange.

In this assignnment i was tasked with edditing starter code to make it more semantic, as a result of this i was able to make the finished product more efficient and easier to read and understand. 

This was acheived by combining & removing elements in CSS & HTML to reduce the amount of space the elements took up in the code edditor, while at the same time leaving the original web application unchanged.
